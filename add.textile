h3. Add event

Do you want to add an event to the calendar? There are a couple of ways to get in touch with us but the easiest by far is to use the form below. You could also "email":mailto:hello@usergroup.se us or get in touch on twitter. You find our accounts on the "crew":/crew.html page.

Please note, we only list free events. See the "about":about.html#rules page for rules.
